# Welcome to EECS 470!

This is the official GitHub organization for *EECS 470:
Computer Architecture* at the University of Michigan.

This organization contains private student and team
repositories for all lab and project sources. Other

### Students

If you're a student in the course, you will receive an
email invite to the organization before the first lab.
Hold tight.

You wil submit projects to our autograder with the
public submission script in CAEN, which will download
graded files from your most recent commit to the `main`
branch on GitHub. See project specifications for
details.
