# Welcome to EECS 470!

This is the official GitHub organization for *EECS 470:
Computer Architecture* at the University of Michigan.

This server contains private student and team repositories for all labs
and projects. Everything else you might need can be found at the main
[Course Website](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs470/).

### Students

If you're a student in the course, you will receive an email invite to
the organization before the first lab. Hold tight :)

If your invitation has expired, email the course staff and we'll send
another.
